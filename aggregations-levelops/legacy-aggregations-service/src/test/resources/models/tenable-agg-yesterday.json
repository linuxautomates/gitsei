An unauthenticated, remote attacker\n  can have unspecified impact via vectors related to decrementing\n  the u variable. (CVE-2016-10166)\n\n  - A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists in\n  ext/imap/php_imap.c. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can\n  exploit this issue, via an empty string in the message argument\n  to the imap_mail function, to cause the application to stop\n  responding. (CVE-2018-19935)\n\n  - A heap-based buffer overflow exists in gdImageColorMatch in\n  gd_color_match.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka LibGD) 2.2.5.\n  An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this via the\n  triggering of imagecolormatch calls with crafted image data, to\n  cause a denial of service condition or the execution of arbitrary\n  code. (CVE-2019-6977)\n\n  - A heap-based buffer over-read exists in the xmlrpc_decode function\n  due to improper validation of input data. An unauthenticated, remote \n  attacker can exploit this, via a specially crafted request, to cause\n  a heap out-of-bounds read or read-after-free condition, which could \n  result in a complete system compromise. (CVE-2019-9020)\n\n  - A heap-based buffer over-read exists in the PHAR reading functions\n  in the PHAR extension, due to improper implementation of memory\n  operations. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,\n  via persuading a user to parse a specially crafted file name on the\n  targeted system, to disclose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-9021)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the\n  dns_get_record function due to improper parsing of DNS responses. An\n  unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a specially\n  crafted DNS reply sent from a rogue DNS server to disclose\n  potentially sensitive information. (CVE-2019-9022)\n\n  - Multiple heap-based buffer over-read instances exist in mbstring\n  regular expression functions due to improper implementation of\n  memory operations. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit\n  this by sending a specially crafted regular expression that contains\n  multibyte sequences, to cause a condition that could allow the\n  attacker to completely compromise the target system. (CVE-2019-9023)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the xmlrpc_decode function\n  due to improper implementation of memory operations. An\n  unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a hostile\n  XMLRPC server to cause PHP to read from memory outside of allocated\n  areas. (CVE-2019-9024)",

It is, therefore, affected by multiple\nvulnerabilities :\n\n  - Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor\n    present and this is used in side channel resistant code\n    paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to\n    construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of\n    using a named curve). In those cases it is possible\n    that such a group does not have the cofactor present.\n    This can occur even where all the parameters match a\n    known named curve. If such a curve is used then\n    OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code\n    paths which may result in full key recovery during an\n    ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an\n    attacker would have to have the ability to time the\n    creation of a large number of signatures where explicit\n    parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an\n    application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt\n    libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are\n    never used. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are\n    affected by this issue. (CVE-2019-1547)\n\n  - OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where\n    it can find a configuration file as well as certificates\n    used for verification in TLS. This directory is most\n    commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable\n    with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options.\n    For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw\n    configuration targets assume that resulting programs and\n    libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and\n    the default prefix for program installation as well as\n    for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw\n    programs are Windows programs, and as such, find\n    themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local',\n    which may be world writable, which enables untrusted\n    users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert\n    CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing\n    engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl'\n    is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and\n    Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However,\n    some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets\n    on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix.\n    OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by\n    this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected\n    deployments this has been assessed as low severity and\n    therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.\n    (CVE-2019-1552)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead\nrelied only on the application's self-reported version number.",

        "vuln_desciption": "The version of tested product installed on the remote host is prior\nto tested version. It is, therefore, affected by multiple\nvulnerabilities :\n\n  - Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor\n    present and this is used in side channel resistant code\n    paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to\n    construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of\n    using a named curve). In those cases it is possible\n    that such a group does not have the cofactor present.\n    This can occur even where all the parameters match a\n    known named curve. If such a curve is used then\n    OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code\n    paths which may result in full key recovery during an\n    ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an\n    attacker would have to have the ability to time the\n    creation of a large number of signatures where explicit\n    parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an\n    application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt\n    libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are\n    never used. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are\n    affected by this issue. (CVE-2019-1547)\n\n  - OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where\n    it can find a configuration file as well as certificates\n    used for verification in TLS. This directory is most\n    commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable\n    with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options.\n    For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw\n    configuration targets assume that resulting programs and\n    libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and\n    the default prefix for program installation as well as\n    for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw\n    programs are Windows programs, and as such, find\n    themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local',\n    which may be world writable, which enables untrusted\n    users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert\n    CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing\n    engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl'\n    is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and\n    Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However,\n    some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets\n    on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix.\n    OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by\n    this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected\n    deployments this has been assessed as low severity and\n    therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.\n    (CVE-2019-1552)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead\nrelied only on the application's self-reported version number.",
