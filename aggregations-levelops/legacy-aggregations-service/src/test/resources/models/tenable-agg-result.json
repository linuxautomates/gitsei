An attacker could\n    cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would\n    only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way\n    that the Proxy Error page was displayed. (CVE-2019-10092)\n\n  - HTTP/2 (2.4.20 through 2.4.39) very early pushes, for example configured with H2PushResource, could lead\n    to an overwrite of memory in the pushing request's pool, leading to crashes. The memory copied is that\n    of the configured push link header values, not data supplied by the client. (CVE-2019-10081)\n\n  - Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained internal data buffering, potentially leading\n    to a denial of service. The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint;\n    however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the\n    wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the\n    servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.

        "vuln_desciption": "The version of tested product installed on the remote host is prior\nto tested version. It is, therefore, affected by multiple\nvulnerabilities :\n\n  - Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor\n    present and this is used in side channel resistant code\n    paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to\n    construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of\n    using a named curve). In those cases it is possible\n    that such a group does not have the cofactor present.\n    This can occur even where all the parameters match a\n    known named curve. If such a curve is used then\n    OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code\n    paths which may result in full key recovery during an\n    ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an\n    attacker would have to have the ability to time the\n    creation of a large number of signatures where explicit\n    parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an\n    application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt\n    libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are\n    never used. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are\n    affected by this issue. (CVE-2019-1547)\n\n  - OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where\n    it can find a configuration file as well as certificates\n    used for verification in TLS. This directory is most\n    commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable\n    with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options.\n    For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw\n    configuration targets assume that resulting programs and\n    libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and\n    the default prefix for program installation as well as\n    for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw\n    programs are Windows programs, and as such, find\n    themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local',\n    which may be world writable, which enables untrusted\n    users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert\n    CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing\n    engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl'\n    is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and\n    Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However,\n    some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets\n    on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix.\n    OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by\n    this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected\n    deployments this has been assessed as low severity and\n    therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.\n    (CVE-2019-1552)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead\nrelied only on the application's self-reported version number.",

The memory copied is that\n    of the configured push link header values, not data supplied by the client. (CVE-2019-10081)\n\n  - Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained internal data buffering, potentially leading\n    to a denial of service. The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint;\n    however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the\n    wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the\n    servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple\nvulnerabilities :\n\n  - Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor\n    present and this is used in side channel resistant code\n    paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to\n    construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of\n    using a named curve). In those cases it is possible\n    that such a group does not have the cofactor present.\n    This can occur even where all the parameters match a\n    known named curve. If such a curve is used then\n    OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code\n    paths which may result in full key recovery during an\n    ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an\n    attacker would have to have the ability to time the\n    creation of a large number of signatures where explicit\n    parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an\n    application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt\n    libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are\n    never used. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are\n    affected by this issue. (CVE-2019-1547)\n\n  - OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where\n    it can find a configuration file as well as certificates\n    used for verification in TLS. This directory is most\n    commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable\n    with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options.\n    For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw\n    configuration targets assume that resulting programs and\n    libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and\n    the default prefix for program installation as well as\n    for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw\n    programs are Windows programs, and as such, find\n    themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local',\n    which may be world writable, which enables untrusted\n    users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert\n    CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing\n    engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl'\n    is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and\n    Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However,\n    some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets\n    on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix.\n    OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by\n    this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected\n    deployments this has been assessed as low severity and\n    therefore we are not creating new releases at this time.\n    (CVE-2019-1552)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead\nrelied only on the application's self-reported version number.",
