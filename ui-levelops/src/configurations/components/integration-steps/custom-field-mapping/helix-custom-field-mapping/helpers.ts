  "At large enterprises a single Perforce depot or a group of depots on a Helix Core server can be used to manage source code for thousands of projects. However SCM metrics like Change Volume, Commit Volume are more meaningful at a project level than at a depot level. The below table helps you pick specific paths in Perforce depots for analysis using SEI Source Code Management widgets. When the table is empty SCM metrics are computed at the depot level.\n" +
